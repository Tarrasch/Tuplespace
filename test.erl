%% Module for performing a quick test on lab3 module.
%% To test your lab, compile it: 
%% c(linda).
%% then compile the test: 
%% c(test).
%% then run:
%% test:test().

%% Here is a run of the test on a correct tuplespace:

%% (node@chalmers)1> c(test).
%% {ok,test}
%% (node@chalmers)2> test:test().
%% TEST: new tuplespace TS created
%% TEST: in(TS, {fish,any}) by process <0.46.0>
%% TEST: in(TS, {fowl,any}) by process <0.47.0>
%% TEST: out(TS, {fish,salmon})
%% TEST: out(TS, {fowl,chicken})
%% Process <0.47.0>
%%      Correct. in operation: {fowl,any} returned tuple: {fowl,chicken}
%% Process <0.46.0>
%%      Correct. in operation: {fish,any} returned tuple: {fish,salmon}
%% TEST: out(TS, {fish,chips})
%% TEST: in(TS, {any,chips}) by process <0.48.0>
%% Process <0.48.0>
%%      Correct. in operation: {any,chips} returned tuple: {fish,chips}
%% TEST: in(TS, {any,any}) by process <0.49.0>
%% Correct. Tuplespace appears to be empty.
